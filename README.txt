Running the GUI.py allows solving the sudoku.
Click onto the place in the grid and input a number. If it fits, then it will be inputted,
otherwise a message in the console will tell you why it doesn't fit there.

Press SPACE button, to initialise the backtracking algorithm that will solve the sudoku.

In GUI.py, you can change variable "sudoku" to choose a sudoku of size 4x4, 9x9 (default) or 16x16.
